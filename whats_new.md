What's new in the current version with respect to v1.0-alpha

1) Removed CESM_settings, CESM_model_code and strataero_forcing folders. This is published on Yoda, keeping this repository more lightweight.
2) Add z-scores to figures for significance testing (TODO)
3) Add separate y-axis to figure showing T0 and L0 because they have different units (TODO)
