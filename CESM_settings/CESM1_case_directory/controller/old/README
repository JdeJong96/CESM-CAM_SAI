Explicit feedback code suite
README

Last updated 11 July 2019

This is a suite of code designed to introduce an explicit feedback loop into the Community Earth System Model.  The code is designed to work with CESM 1.2.0 on Cheyenne.  It may also work with CESM 1.0.3 or CESM2, but there are no guarantees.

This code is under development.  Please contact Ben Kravitz prior to distribution.

Files included in this suite:
- main.py:  This is the main script that should be called from the short term archiving script st_archive.  This also contains the "namelist" for the main script.  User-modifiable things are in here.
- driver.py:  This contains all of the subroutines that the main script uses and calls them in the right order.
- commonroutines.py:  This contains common routines for analysis (like global mean).
- PIcontrol.py:  This is an implementation of proportional-integral control.  This is user modifiable.
